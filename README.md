## About

This whole thing a big dumb-dumb prototype that should be thrown away.

Features:

- A localStorage layer for persistance of check-in data if you close your browser
- Location data is a static JSON file exposed through the Fetch API: locations can be edited/added through pull requests to `locations.json`.
- A no-backend solution to completing the crawl: just send an email with pre-populated `to:` and `subject:` fields

## Other resources

- a [`stumbl`](https://github.com/Skookum/stumbl-2019) prototype
- initial location data provided by [openstreetmap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) ðŸ—º 
- [recommended listening](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/312lJD7i8xLl0BNvx3kif9?si=XqaLLTyBRXS798W2mE3tvA) ðŸŽ§ 

## Roadmap

- [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) UI layer?
